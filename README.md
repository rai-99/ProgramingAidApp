# ProgramingAidApp
An app that was created to help first year students understand and test their programming knowledge. 
To run the app, you must have Android Studio and must be at least using the 3.4.3 version.
Link to download: https://developer.android.com/studio
A word document outlining how to build and run the app is also provided in the repository.
This was created as part of a final year university project and I decided to upload on Github thinking that it might be useful for novice programmers.

Thanks
